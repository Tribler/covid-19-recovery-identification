# Immunity Passports
## Building a Critical Infrastructure for the Nation-Wide Identification of Recovered COVID-19 Patients


### Backend setup:
To install all requirements for the Python certification-service, run in your terminal: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
Then you can start the service by typing:
```
python3 main.py
```

### Frontend setup:
1. Install all dependencies - Navigate to the frontend application folder "SSI-App" and run in your terminal:
```
yarn
```
2. Start Expo in web development mode -  In the SSI-App folder run:
```
yarn web
```
- This will open two tabs in your default browser:
    - The first is the Expo developer tools, it gives you some feedback on errors and connections
    - The second is the application in WebApp mode, which you can interact with

### Developing with Expo:
- Expo runs a local server that delivers your application, by default the app is delivered at port 19006
 - Using something like ngrok you can expose port 19006 so you can access your app online
